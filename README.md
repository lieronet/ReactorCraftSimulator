We use exactly the same algorithm as the mod itself (tons of random) and give the important data you need in a minute instead of hours or days waiting in creative & superflat.

Thanks to DPurple for the java version simulator. I converted it to Javascript and wrapped it with AngularJS and Bootstrap.
