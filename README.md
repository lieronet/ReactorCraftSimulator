# ReactorCraftSimulator
This is a simulator for Reika's minecraft mod ReactorCraft.

We use exactly the same algorithm as the mod itself (tons of random) and give the important data you need in a minute instead of hours or days waiting in creative & superflat.

BUT I am not responsible for the explosion of your reactor. :P

Thanks to DPurple for the java version simulator. I converted it to Javascript and wrapped it with AngularJS and Bootstrap.
